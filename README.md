# CutTheCode Landing Page

Welcome to the repository for the CutTheCode.com landing page! This project showcases my work in building the website for CutTheCode, which has been recognized with an honorable mention at the Awwwards. Here, I'd like to highlight the predominant use of Tailwind CSS for most visual effects, with minimal use of Vue.js to maintain project simplicity.

## Project Description

This repository contains the source code for the CutTheCode.com landing page, a website that has gained recognition for its outstanding design at the Awwwards. The page focuses on presenting key information in an attractive and easily understandable manner, showcasing visual elegance.

## Technologies Used

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is the primary styling framework used in this project. It has been extensively employed to apply styles and visual effects throughout the site. The choice to use Tailwind CSS is based on its pragmatic approach to building user interfaces, enabling rapid and efficient development.

### Nuxt.js

Nuxt.js, built on Vue.js, has been used to structure and organize the project. Although used sparingly, Vue.js has proven invaluable for creating interactive and dynamic components in certain parts of the site.

## Project Structure

The project follows a clear and organized structure, with components, styles, and scripts distributed logically in their respective directories.

```plaintext
